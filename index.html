<h1>Common Lisp Community Survey 2024</h1>

<p>Hello. My name is Daniel Haskin. I'm conducting a survey of the Common Lisp
Community in 2024. I will run the survey for six weeks, starting on Saturday,
June 15, 2024, and ending on Saturday, July 27, 2024. I will publish the results
on the first Saturday in August 2024.</p>

<p>I have written the survey in plain text. If you wish to take the survey, please
fill out the survey and email it to me at <img src="./email.png" alt="my
email"/>. Your
email will not be saved or shared with anyone else. As soon as I have the
survey, I will record the content of the email only and I will delete the email.
I will not record the email address. If you wish to entirely remain anonymous,
you may use a temporary email service such as <a
    href="https://temp-mail.org/en/">Temp
    Mail</a>. All responses will remain anonymous.</p>

<p>The survey text is below.</p>
